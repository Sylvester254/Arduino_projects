## The system monitors the following conditions:
    i. Temperature - Temperatures above room temperature (25 degrees Celsius) are flagged as high temperature and an alarm is set off or measures taken to maintain room temperature. Therefore, a temperature sensor is needed. 
    ii. Gas levels - A gas sensor is required to detect leaking gases that may cause industrial fires.
    iii. Lighting - Low lighting can cause industrial accidents while extremely high lighting can cause eye problems to the workers. This is why a light sensor is necessary to detect any changes in the lighting and trigger the light bulbs.Additionally, the security lights need to be activated at night.
    iv. Fire - Fire sensors are also necessary to detect fire danger and measures takes to prevent further damages. Temperature sensor can also prove to be of great help if they are put to work  together.
    v. Movement â€“ During those times when the premises are closed, movement of any kind around the premises would be suspicious. Motion sensors may therefore be necessary to detect any movement at odd hours.

- This system is required to display all this information in realtime, therefore, an LCD display is necessary in this system.
