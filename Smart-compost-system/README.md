This code interacts with Arduino Uno and three sensors:
~ Analog Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor(corrosion resistant)
~ DS18b20 Temperature Probe Sensor
~ MQ-4 Methane Gas Detection Sensor Module
Arduino Uno recieves the values recorded by the three sensors and gives output via LEDs based on the instructions within the code.
Each block of code is explained further within the code.
